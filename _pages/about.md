Hey there! I'm currently a software engineer at HAOMO.AI TECH, where I'm focused on developing a robust localization system for large-scale and long-term autonomy. Welcome to join us if you are looking for a related job!

I grew up in mainland China, which is an incredible and miraculous place in the world. I was born in Xiangxiang City, which happens to be the hometown of Great Mao! I lived there for 15 years and had a fascinating childhood. After that, I went to Changsha and graduated from Yali High School in 2014. Changsha is a famous city known for its laid-back lifestyle and delicious food! Yali High School, a life-changing institution, transformed me into someone with a global perspective and a drive to make a difference in the world. After the Chinese college entrance examination, I embarked on a thrilling 7-day solo cycling adventure covering 1000km from Changsha to Hangzhou! Later, I resided in Hangzhou City for 9 years and earned my B.E. and PhD degrees from Zhejiang University in 2018 and 2023, respectively. Hangzhou is an incredibly beautiful and culturally advanced city renowned worldwide for its stunning West Lake. Throughout my PhD, my primary focus was on LiDAR SLAM, place recognition, and localization. Additionally, I have published several papers in top-tier conferences and journals such as ICCV, CVPR, IROS, IEEE TIV, and IEEE RAL. Currently, I'm in Beijing, diving into the exhilarating field of autonomous driving!
