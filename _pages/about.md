Hello, there! I am now a software engineer at HAOMO.AI TECH and working on building a robust localization system for large-scale and long-term autonomy. Welcome to join us if you are looking for a job!

I grow up in the mainland of China, an amazing and miracle place in the world. I was born in Xiangxiang City, the hometown of Great Mao! I lived there for 15 years and had an interesting childhood. Then, I went to Changsha and graduated from Yali High school in 2014. Changsha is a famous city for its casual lifestyle and yummy food! As a schoold that can "change one's life", Yali changed me and shaped me into a person with an international perspective and passions to change the world. After the Chinese college entrance examination, I spent 7 days cycling from Changsha to Hangzhou by myself. It's an exciting travel for 1000km! Then, I lived in Hangzhou City for 9 years and received my B.E. and PhD degrees from Zhejiang University in 2018 and 2023, respectively. Hangzhou is a beautiful and highly civilized city. It's well-known all over the world for West Lake. During my PhD, I mainly study on LiDAR SLAM, place recognition, and localization. I had published several papers in ICCV/CVPR/IROS/IEEE TIV/IEEE RAL. Now, I'm in Beijing and working on the exciting field of autonoumos driving!
